## What Is NOT Working (Declining Patterns)

**Generic Motivational Content:**
- "Hustle harder" messaging without substance
- Inspirational quotes over stock video

- Platform-specific optimization required
- Lazy cross-posting obvious and ineffective

**Long-Winded Intros:**
- More than 5 seconds of fluff before value
- "Hey guys, welcome back..." = instant scroll
- Front-load value or lose viewer

---

## Platform Algorithm Shifts (Q4 2024 - Q1 2025)

### TikTok
- Prioritizing longer watch time (45-60s) over sheer views
- Original sound gaining favor vs. trending audio
- Comment engagement weighted heavier in distribution
- Creator-viewer relationship signals (repeat viewers)

### Instagram Reels
- Save rate primary signal (stronger than likes)
- Shares to Stories = amplification trigger
- De-emphasizing hashtags (AI content matching prioritized)
- Penalizing TikTok watermarks more aggressively

### YouTube
