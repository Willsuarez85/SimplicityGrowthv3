- "The biggest mistake I see Latino businesses make on Instagram"
- "You're wasting money on ads if you're not doing this first"

**Pattern B: Curiosity Gap**

- Face or key visual on screen instantly (no fade-ins)

### 3. Visual & Editing Patterns

**On-Screen Text Usage:**
- 89% of high-performing Reels use captions
- Auto-captions enabled (accessibility + watch-without-sound)
- Manual caption styling: Bold sans-serif fonts
- Positioning: Bottom third or center (avoiding profile pic overlay)
- Color: White with black stroke, or solid background box

### 4. Cover Image Optimization

**Cover Design Principles:**
- Custom cover image (not auto-generated frame)
- 3-5 words of text maximum
- High contrast, bold fonts
- Face with clear emotion preferred
- Brand color consistency across feed
- Preview of value/topic without revealing entire hook

**Text on Cover:**

- Benefit-driven phrasing
- Spanish or English based on audio language

**Aesthetic Cohesion:**

### 7. Engagement Drivers

**Save Rate Optimization:**
- Educational content with actionable steps
- Resource lists (tools, templates, frameworks)
- Step-by-step guides
- "Save this for later" explicit CTA
- High save rate = Instagram signals value = broader distribution

**Comment Rate Tactics:**
- Ask a direct question in caption or final frame
- Controversial/debate-worthy statements
- "Comment X if you agree"
- Interactive prompts (poll-style questions in captions)

**Share Rate Drivers:**
- Highly relatable content (tag a friend who needs this)
- Motivational/inspirational messaging
- Controversial hot takes
- Valuable resources (save and share to help others)

**Caption Strategy:**
- First line critical (appears before "...more")
- Hook in first sentence (don't waste with fluff)
- Expand on Reel content (add context, not duplication)
- Hashtags: 3-5 relevant (declining importance vs. TikTok)
- CTA: Clear next step (save, comment, follow, DM)

### 8. Hashtag Performance (Instagram-Specific)

**Hashtag Strategy Shift:**
- Instagram de-emphasizing hashtags in favor of AI content matching
- 3-5 hashtags sufficient (not 30 like old Instagram)
- Niche-specific > broad trending
- Branded hashtag for campaign tracking

**Effective Hashtags (Latino Marketing Niche):**
- `#marketingdigital` (broad reach)
- `#negocioslatinos` (niche community)
- `#emprendedoresusa` (location + audience)
- `#pymedigital` (small business focus)
- `#instagramparaempresas` (platform-specific)

**Hashtag Placement:**
- In caption (first comment method declining)
- Below main caption text (separated by line breaks)
- Avoid hashtag-stuffing (spammy appearance)

### 9. Posting Frequency & Timing

**Upload Frequency:**
- 3-5 Reels per week = sustainable growth
- 1 per day = accelerated growth (requires content system)
- Quality > quantity (1 great Reel > 5 mediocre)
- Consistency matters more than volume

**Best Posting Times (Eastern Time - Latino Audience):**
- Weekday mornings: 7-9 AM (commute scrolling)
- Lunch hours: 12-1 PM (break time)
- Evenings: 6-9 PM (post-work relaxation)
- Weekends: 9-11 AM, 4-7 PM (leisure browsing)

**Timing Considerations:**
- Test and analyze your specific audience
- Instagram Insights show when followers are active
- Post 1-2 hours before peak activity (algorithm warm-up)

### 10. Audio Strategy

**Original Audio vs. Trending Sounds:**
- Original audio (voiceover + music) = better long-term performance
- Trending sounds = short-term visibility boost
- Hybrid approach: Original voiceover with trending background music

**Voiceover Best Practices:**
- Clear, energetic delivery (not monotone)
- Pacing: 160-180 words per minute
- Background music at 20-30% volume
- Audio quality matters (external mic preferred)

**Music Selection:**
- Upbeat, positive energy for motivational content
- Instrumental/lo-fi for educational content
- Latin music (reggaeton, trap) for culturally resonant content
- Trending audio from Reels Audio page (curated by Instagram)

### 11. Collaboration & Features

**Collab Feature:**
- Joint Reels with complementary creators
- Expands reach to both audiences
- Partner selection: aligned values + overlapping but not identical audience

**Remix Feature:**
- Respond to trending Reels
- Add commentary or perspective
- Piggyback on viral content momentum

**Add Yours Sticker (Stories + Reels):**
- Community-driven challenges
- User-generated content prompts
- Engagement loop creation

### 12. Algorithm Signals (Instagram-Specific)

**What Instagram Prioritizes:**
- Watch time (completion rate)
- Replays (indicator of value)
- Saves (strong signal of utility)
- Shares (amplification signal)
- Comments (engagement depth)
- Profile visits after watching (interest signal)

**What Hurts Distribution:**
- Low completion rate (viewers drop off early)
- Recycled TikTok content (watermarks detected)
- Misleading hooks (clickbait without payoff)
- Low engagement velocity (slow initial traction)
- Copyrighted audio (muted or limited distribution)

### 13. Cross-Promotion Strategy

**Reels to Stories Pipeline:**
- Share Reel to Story with teaser text
- Polls/questions on Story to drive engagement
- Behind-the-scenes Story content to humanize

**Reels to Feed Posts:**
- Carousel posts expand on Reel topics
- Single-image posts complement Reel themes
- Mix content types for algorithm diversity

**Reels to DMs (Lead Generation):**
- CTA: "DM me [word] for the template"
- Automated DM responses with lead magnets
- Conversation starters to qualify leads

### 14. What Is NOT Working

**Low-Performance Patterns:**
- Reposted TikTok content with watermarks (Instagram penalizes)
- Overly promotional/salesy content (turns off audience)
- Low-quality video (grainy, poor lighting, shaky footage)
- Talking head with no visual variety (boring, low retention)
- Generic stock footage (feels inauthentic)
- Long text walls in captions (low readability)
- No hook (assumes viewer will stay)
- Inconsistent posting (algorithm doesn't prioritize sporadic creators)

**Aesthetic Misses:**
- Cluttered visuals (too much happening on screen)
- Mismatched fonts and colors (unprofessional)
- Poor audio mixing (music drowning out voice)
- Low contrast text (hard to read)
