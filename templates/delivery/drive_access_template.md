- Use "Viewer" access for reference-only needs
- Add to specific folders, not root client folder

### External Sharing
- Always use "Viewer" access unless edit is required
- Set expiration dates for temporary access
- Share specific folders/files, not entire client folder

### Client Sharing
- Share only from `05-Deliverables` folder
- Use clean, client-friendly file names
- Remove internal notes before sharing
