## Follower-to-Post Ratio Analysis

Higher ratio suggests better content resonance:

| Account | Followers | Posts | Ratio |
|---------|-----------|-------|-------|
| Cardenas Markets | 64,000 | 2,083 | 30.7 |
| Compare Foods CLT | 21,000 | 1,399 | 15.0 |

| Compare Foods (secondary) | 2,365 | 892 | 2.6 |
| Wow Supermarket | 1,602 | 324 | 4.9 |
| El Rey Supermercado | 517 | 10 | 51.7 |

**Observations:**
- El Rey's high ratio (51.7) is misleading - reflects minimal activity, not effectiveness
- Cardenas' 30.7 ratio represents industry benchmark for engaged following
- Compare Foods' 15.0 ratio shows solid content performance
- Low post counts correlate with low follower counts

## Content Volume Analysis

Estimated annual posting rates:

| Competitor | Posts (Total) | Est. Years Active | Est. Posts/Year |

| Cardenas Markets | 2,083 | 5+ | ~400 |
| Talpa Supermercados | 1,772 | 5+ | ~350 |
| Compare Foods CLT | 1,399 | 4+ | ~350 |
| Compare Foods (secondary) | 892 | 3+ | ~300 |
| Wow Supermarket | 324 | 3+ | ~100 |
| El Rey Supermercado | 10 | Unknown | <12 |

**Minimum viable frequency**: Based on successful competitors, 4-5 posts per week (200-250/year) appears to be the threshold for meaningful growth.

Based on competitor analysis, platform investment patterns reveal:

### Instagram
- **Most invested platform** across all competitors

### Facebook
- **Secondary platform** for most competitors
- Used for weekly ads and promotional content
- Talpa uses Facebook Pixel for retargeting (advanced)
- Community groups and event promotion

### Website/E-Commerce
- **Significant gap** in Charlotte market
- Only El Rey has e-commerce capability locally
- Reference brands (Cardenas, Talpa) demonstrate full e-commerce
