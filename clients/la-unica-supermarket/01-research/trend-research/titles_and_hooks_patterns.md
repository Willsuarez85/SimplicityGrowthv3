---

## Introduction

This document catalogs proven hook formulas and title structures observed across TikTok, Instagram Reels, and YouTube in the grocery/food retail space. Each pattern is documented with examples, performance signals, and La Unica-specific applications.

Hooks are the first 0.25-3 seconds of content that determine whether viewers stay or scroll. In 2026, hook strength is the primary filter for algorithmic distribution across all platforms.

---

## Universal Hook Principles (All Platforms)

### The 0.25 Second Rule
Viewers decide to stay or scroll in less than one second. The hook must create immediate cognitive dissonance, curiosity, or emotional response.

### Hook Components
1. **Visual Element:** What they see (motion, contrast, text, face)
2. **Audio Element:** What they hear (music beat, statement, sound effect)
3. **Text Element:** What they read (bold overlay, caption preview)

**Best Performance:** All three elements aligned (visual + audio + text working together)

### Hook Psychology
- **Pattern Interrupt:** Break expected scrolling behavior
- **Curiosity Gap:** Promise information they don't have
- **Emotional Trigger:** Surprise, nostalgia, pride, humor, urgency
- **Social Proof:** "Everyone's talking about this"
- **Identity Affirmation:** "If you know, you know"

---

## Hook Formula Library

### FORMULA 1: POV (Point of View)

**Structure:** "POV: [Relatable Situation]"

**Why It Works:**
- Immersive first-person perspective
- Trending format across all platforms
- Instantly relatable
- Low production barrier

**Platform Performance:**
- TikTok: Extremely high usage, still effective
- Instagram Reels: Strong performance, native format
- YouTube Shorts: Moderate performance, less common

**Examples for La Unica:**

| Hook | Application | Expected Reaction |
|------|-------------|-------------------|
| "POV: You finally try REAL pan dulce" | First-time customer experience | Curiosity + validation seeking |
| "POV: Your abuela takes you to La Unica" | Cultural nostalgia moment | Emotional connection |
| "POV: The butcher custom cuts your order" | Premium service demonstration | Aspirational desire |
| "POV: You smell fresh tortillas at 7am" | Sensory experience invitation | Memory trigger |
| "POV: You find out we make 500 tortillas daily" | Scale/quality revelation | Surprise, credibility |

**Execution Notes:**
- Film from first-person perspective when possible
- Use trending audio that matches POV format
- Text overlay appears within first second
- Show outcome or reaction by end

---

### FORMULA 2: Direct Question

**Structure:** "[Question that creates information gap]"

**Why It Works:**
- Engages internal dialogue
- Creates completion loop (must watch for answer)
- Searchable (SEO benefit on YouTube)
- Drives comments (engagement)

**Platform Performance:**
- TikTok: High performance, especially with controversial questions
- Instagram Reels: Very effective for educational content
- YouTube: Excellent for search optimization

**Examples for La Unica:**

| "What's the difference between THESE two cuts?" | Explain meat selection | Tutorial, expertise |
| "Want to know the secret to perfect tamales?" | Ingredient quality from La Unica | Recipe, product placement |
| "Can you name all these pan dulce?" | Quiz format, showcase varieties | Interactive, discovery |

**Execution Notes:**
- Ask question in both text AND voiceover
- Pause 1-2 seconds after question (tension)
- Deliver clear answer (don't leave unresolved)
- End with CTA related to question

---

### FORMULA 3: Bold Claim/Statement

**Structure:** "[Strong declarative statement that demands proof]"

**Why It Works:**
- Creates immediate cognitive dissonance ("Really? Prove it.")
- Triggers controversy (comment engagement)
- Positions as authority
- High shareability (people tag others to debate)

**Platform Performance:**
- TikTok: Very high performance, thrives on controversy
- Instagram Reels: Good performance, less confrontational culture

| "This is what pan dulce SHOULD taste like" | Fresh vs store-bought comparison | Medium-High |
| "We sell out by 10am every single day" | Time-lapse of empty shelves | Low (social proof) |
| "Your grocery store doesn't have THIS" | Unique products showcase | Medium |

**Execution Notes:**

2. **Text Placement:**
   - Top third vs center vs bottom third

3. **Text Animation:**
   - Instant appear vs fade in vs slide in

**Metric Priorities:**

- YouTube: CTR, average view duration

---

## Hook Don'ts (Avoid These)

### 1. Misleading Clickbait
**Don't:** "You WON'T BELIEVE what we found in our kitchen"
**Why:** Damages trust, high scroll-away after disappointing payoff

### 2. Overused Generic Hooks
**Don't:** "Wait for it..." / "Watch till the end"
**Why:** Tired format, viewers have seen thousands of times

### 3. Slow Burn Hooks
**Don't:** "Let me tell you a story. So yesterday morning I was thinking..."
**Why:** Too slow, viewers scroll before you get to point

### 4. No Clear Value Proposition
**Don't:** "Here's a video about our store"
**Why:** Generic, no reason to care

### 5. Text Blocks
**Don't:** Paragraph of small text in first frame
**Why:** Unreadable on mobile, information overload

---

## Cultural Sensitivity in Hooks

### Celebrate Without Appropriation

**Good Examples:**
- "This is how my family has made tortillas for generations"
- "Let me teach you about Mexican pan dulce tradition"
- "Come learn about authentic Mexican ingredients"

**Avoid:**
- Stereotypical accents or caricatures
- "Authentic" as gatekeeping (dismissing others)
- Cultural elements as comedy props

### Bilingual Hook Strategies

**Spanish-First:**
- Hook in Spanish, caption in English (or vice versa)
- Reaches Spanish-speakers, captions make accessible to all
- Example: "Mira como hacemos tortillas frescas cada día" [Watch how we make fresh tortillas daily]

**Code-Switching:**
- Natural mix of Spanish and English (Spanglish)
- Reflects authentic Hispanic American experience
- Example: "This is the pan dulce that hits different"

**Dual-Text:**
- Spanish text overlay + English caption (or vice versa)
- Accessible to both audiences
- Inclusive approach

---
