## Market Context

### U.S. Hispanic Population & Economic Power

The U.S. Hispanic population represents:
- **65+ million people** (approximately 19% of U.S. population)
- **$2.8 trillion in purchasing power** (and growing)
- **Youngest demographic** with median age of 30 years
- **Digital-first adoption patterns**, particularly mobile-centric

### Digital Marketing Landscape for Hispanic Audiences

The market is characterized by:

1. **Translation vs. Transcreation Divide**: Many agencies offer basic translation services, but the market increasingly demands cultural adaptation (transcreation) that resonates authentically with diverse Latino subcultures.

2. **AI Integration Wave**: Competitors are rapidly integrating AI tools for audience targeting, content creation, campaign optimization, and analytics. Spanish+Media's "Maya F1" AI platform represents the leading edge of this trend.

3. **In-Culture Marketing Demand**: Brands increasingly recognize that reaching Hispanic consumers requires more than language translation—it requires cultural fluency, understanding of nuances across Mexican, Caribbean, Central American, and South American audiences.

4. **Fragmented Media Landscape**: From traditional Spanish-language TV (Univision, Telemundo) to digital-first platforms, reaching Hispanic audiences requires multi-channel expertise.
