# Marble Future - Image Generation Prompts
## Simplicity Agency Visual Identity

**Concept:** "Blueprints for Growth" meets "Marble Future"
**Version:** 2.0
**Updated:** December 2024

---

## Photography Direction

### Core Principles
- **Statues:** Warriors, leaders, strategic figures (NOT philosophers)
- **Technology:** CARVED INTO the stone, integrated, NOT worn as accessories
- **Backgrounds:** Pure black (#000000), NO particles, NO smoke, NO floating elements
- **Lighting:** Dramatic chiaroscuro, museum-quality
- **Feel:** Museo + Laboratorio (NOT mystical)

### What to AVOID
- Philosophers or contemplative poses
- Tech as wearable accessories (earbuds, glasses)
- Floating particles, smoke, magical elements
- Gold accents (use turquoise #09B9B4 ONLY when needed, sparingly)
- Neon, glitch, cyborg aesthetics

## Cropping Guidelines

### Hero Images (16:9)
- Subject centered or rule-of-thirds positioned
- Leave 20% breathing room around main subject
- Never crop through carved patterns

### Square Posts (1:1)
- Face/subject fills 70% of frame
- Centered composition preferred
- Strong lighting contrast maintained

### Portrait/Stories (9:16)
- Subject in upper 60% of frame
- Lower area for text overlay space
- Vertical flow of carved patterns

### Cards/Thumbnails
- Crop to strongest detail
- Maintain at least one clear carved pattern visible
- High contrast essential for small sizes
