# Tone of Voice Guidelines – Simplicity Agency

**Version:** 3.0
**Date:** December 31, 2024
**Purpose:** Define how Simplicity Agency sounds across all communication

---

## Voice Foundation

**Our voice is:**
- **Clear** over clever
- **Direct** over diplomatic
- **Confident** over cautious
- **Grounded** over aspirational
- **Real** over polished

**We sound like:**
A growth partner who respects your intelligence, learns your business deeply, and tells you the truth—even when it's not what you want to hear. We're partners, not vendors.

---

## Core Voice Attributes

### 1. **Clear (Clarity Over Complexity)**

**What It Means:**
We eliminate jargon. We use simple words. We explain concepts in plain language. If we can't say it simply, we don't understand it well enough.

**Sounds Like:**
- "We'll test 3 different ad messages to see which one gets you more customers"
- "Your current website converts 2% of visitors. We'll redesign it to hit 5%"
- "This costs $3,000/month. Here's exactly what you get"
- "We connect your marketing to your sales—so you see the full picture"

**Doesn't Sound Like:**
- "We'll leverage synergistic optimization protocols to enhance conversion efficacy"
- "Our omnichannel approach maximizes touchpoint engagement"
- "Investment required: Let's discuss your budget parameters"

**Writing Rules:**
- Use the 8th-grade reading level test
- Replace marketing jargon with everyday words
- Define acronyms on first use
- Break complex ideas into bullet points
- Use examples, not abstractions

---

### 2. **Direct (No BS)**

**What It Means:**
We get to the point. We don't hide behind corporate speak. We say what we mean. We don't soften hard truths.

**Sounds Like:**
- "You're not ready for ads yet. Fix your offer first"
- "This campaign failed. Here's why, and here's what we're changing"
- "We can't help you if your budget is under $2K/month. Here are other options"
- "Your marketing and sales are disconnected. That's where leads are dying"

**Doesn't Sound Like:**
- "While we explore optimization opportunities, let's consider strategic alignment"
- "The results weren't optimal, but we gained valuable learnings"
- "Let's schedule a discovery call to assess fit parameters"

**Writing Rules:**
- Start with the conclusion
- Say "no" when the answer is no
- Don't bury the lead in the third paragraph
- Avoid passive voice ("mistakes were made" → "we made a mistake")
- Cut filler words: very, really, just, actually, basically

---

### 3. **Partner-Minded (We're In This Together)**

**What It Means:**
We speak as partners, not service providers. We share accountability. We use "we" because we're building this together.

**Sounds Like:**
- "Here's what we're seeing in the data and what we recommend"
- "We need to adjust the strategy—here's why and what changes"
- "This worked. Let's scale it."
- "We're going all in on this together"

**Doesn't Sound Like:**
- "As per your request, we have completed the deliverables"
- "Please find attached the report you ordered"
- "We await your approval to proceed"

**Writing Rules:**
- Use "we" and "our" (partnership language)
- Share responsibility for outcomes (not just activity)
- Celebrate wins together
- Own problems together

---

### 4. **Outcome-Focused (Results, Not Activity)**

**What It Means:**
We connect everything to business outcomes. We explain the "why" behind every recommendation. We think like business partners, not marketing vendors.

**Sounds Like:**
- "We're running these ads because your bottleneck is lead volume, not conversion rate"
- "This follow-up system recovers an estimated 20% of leads that would otherwise go cold"
- "We're pausing TikTok to double down on Google Ads—higher intent, better ROI"
- "This campaign generated $47K in revenue from $3K in spend"

**Doesn't Sound Like:**
- "Let's do a TikTok because TikTok is hot right now"
- "We need more content for the algorithm"
- "Best practice is to post 3x per week"
- "We got 10,000 impressions!"

**Writing Rules:**
- Always connect activity to business outcome
- Lead with the outcome, then explain the tactic
- Use financial language (ROI, CAC, LTV, profit margin, revenue)
- Reference data to support recommendations
- Frame decisions as investments, not costs

---

### 5. **Honest (No Hype)**

**What It Means:**
We don't overpromise. We don't hype. We don't use superlatives we can't prove. We tell the truth, even when it's inconvenient.

**Sounds Like:**
- "Most businesses see results in 60-90 days, not overnight"
- "We can't guarantee you'll go viral. We can guarantee we'll test what works"
- "This might not work. Here's our backup plan if it doesn't"
- "The honest answer is: it depends. Here are the variables"

**Doesn't Sound Like:**
- "We'll 10x your revenue in 30 days guaranteed!"
- "Our proprietary system has never failed"
- "You'll dominate your market"
- "Secret formula for unlimited leads"

**Writing Rules:**
- Use specific numbers, not vague promises
- Acknowledge uncertainty when it exists
- Set realistic timelines
- Celebrate real wins, not potential outcomes
- Never use "guarantee" unless legally binding

## Do's and Don'ts

### ✅ DO:

| Context | Do This | Example |
|---------|---------|---------|
| **Explaining Services** | Use specific outcomes | "We build lead generation systems that connect to your sales process" |
| **Pricing** | State numbers clearly | "This costs $3,000/month" |
| **Results** | Use real data | "This partner went from $10K to $47K/month in 90 days" |
| **Mistakes** | Own them directly | "We miscalculated your budget. Here's how we're fixing it" |
| **Timelines** | Set realistic expectations | "Most campaigns take 60-90 days to optimize" |
| **AI/Automation** | Explain practical benefit | "Our AI follow-up system contacts leads within 5 minutes—24/7" |

---

### ❌ DON'T:

| Context | Don't Do This | Why It's Off-Brand |
|---------|--------------|-------------------|
| **Explaining Services** | "Synergistic omnichannel solutions" | Jargon kills clarity |
| **Pricing** | "Let's discuss your investment parameters" | Say the number |
| **Results** | "Amazing engagement metrics!" | Vanity metrics ≠ growth |
| **Mistakes** | "Challenges were encountered" | Passive voice avoids accountability |
| **Timelines** | "Explosive growth in 30 days!" | Overpromising |
| **AI/Automation** | "Revolutionary AI-powered disruption" | Hype over substance |

---

## On-Brand vs Off-Brand Examples

### Example 1: Service Description

**Off-Brand:**
"We leverage cutting-edge digital marketing strategies to optimize your brand's online presence across multiple touchpoints, driving engagement and conversions through data-driven insights."

**On-Brand:**
"We build growth systems that bring you customers while you sleep. Marketing connected to sales. AI-powered follow-up. Measurable results."

**Why:** The off-brand version uses jargon ("leverage," "touchpoints") and focuses on process. The on-brand version uses simple language and focuses on outcomes.

---

### Example 2: Email Subject Lines

**Off-Brand:**
- "Exclusive Opportunity to Maximize Your ROI"
- "Unlock Your Business's Full Potential"
- "Strategic Partnership Inquiry"

**On-Brand:**
- "Your ads aren't working. Here's why"
- "Quick question about your growth goals"
- "Can we help you hit $50K/month?"

**Why:** Off-brand sounds like spam. On-brand sounds like a real person starting a real conversation.

---

### Example 3: Social Media Post

**Off-Brand:**
"Thrilled to announce that our innovative AI-powered solutions have empowered yet another valued client to achieve unprecedented success in their market vertical! 🚀 #DigitalMarketing #Success"

**On-Brand:**
"Our partner Sarah just hit $30K in one month. Last year, she was doing $8K. Same business. Better system. Proof that when marketing and sales connect, growth follows. 📊"

**Why:** Off-brand is vague and hype-filled. On-brand uses specific numbers, real outcomes, and clear cause-and-effect.

---

### Example 4: Handling Bad News

**Off-Brand:**
"While campaign performance did not align with initial projections, we remain committed to optimizing outcomes through iterative testing protocols."

**On-Brand:**
"This campaign didn't work. We spent $2,400 and got 12 leads when we projected 40. We're killing it and testing a new approach this week. No charge for the wasted spend."

**Why:** Off-brand hides behind corporate language. On-brand owns the failure directly and states the fix clearly.

---

### Example 5: AI/Technology Claims

**Off-Brand:**
"Our revolutionary AI-powered platform leverages machine learning to disrupt traditional marketing paradigms and deliver unprecedented results."

**On-Brand:**
"We use AI to automate your follow-up. When a lead comes in at 2am, they get a response in 5 minutes—not 5 hours. That alone recovers 20% of leads that would otherwise go cold."

**Why:** Off-brand is empty hype. On-brand explains exactly what the AI does and why it matters for the business.

---

## Voice in Crisis or Conflict

**When Things Go Wrong:**
- State the problem directly
- Own responsibility (no passive voice)
- Explain the fix with timeline
- Offer compensation if appropriate
- Follow up proactively

**Example:**
"We misconfigured your Facebook pixel. You lost tracking data for 3 days. This is our fault. We've fixed it and rebuilt the missing data. We're crediting you $500 for the error. Here's what we're doing to prevent this from happening again."

**Not This:**
"A technical issue was identified regarding data collection parameters. Our team has implemented corrective measures and remains committed to optimal performance."

- Partnership language deepens

**The voice should never:**
- Become overly polished or corporate
- Lose its directness or honesty
- Use jargon to sound smarter
- Overpromise to sound more impressive
- Sound like a vendor instead of a partner
