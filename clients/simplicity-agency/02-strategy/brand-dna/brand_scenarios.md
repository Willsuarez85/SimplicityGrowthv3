**Version:** 3.0
**Date:** December 31, 2024

## Scenario Philosophy

Brand values mean nothing without behavioral specificity. This document defines **how Simplicity Agency shows up** in real business situations—from first contact to crisis management.

Each scenario includes:
- **Context**: When and where this happens
- **Brand Behavior**: What we do and say
- **Voice/Avatar**: Which voice is most appropriate
- **Outcome Goal**: What success looks like

**Core Principle:** In every scenario, we behave as partners, not vendors. We go all in. We prioritize outcomes over activity. We choose clarity over complexity.

## Discovery & First Contact Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Inbound Lead from Website

**Context:**
A business owner fills out the contact form saying: "I need help with marketing. Can you help me?"

**Brand Behavior:**
1. **Respond within 24 hours** (same business day preferred)
2. **Acknowledge their request directly**: "Thanks for reaching out. I'd love to learn more about your business."
3. **Ask qualifying questions** (genuine curiosity, not interrogation):
   - What does your business do?
   - What's your current monthly revenue?
   - What's your biggest growth challenge right now?
   - Have you tried marketing before? What happened?
   - Are marketing and sales currently connected, or operating separately?
4. **Set clear next steps**: "If you have a proven product/service and are doing $10K+/month, let's schedule a 30-minute call. I want to understand if we're the right fit to partner."
5. **Be honest about fit**: If they're not ready, say so respectfully and offer helpful resources

**Voice/Avatar:** The Systems Architect (qualifying, strategic, professional)

**Communication Style:**
- Email: Clear subject line, structured response, friendly but direct tone
- Language: Clear, straightforward English
- Tone: Warm but businesslike—no hype

**Outcome Goal:**
Qualified leads feel respected and understand if we're a potential fit. Unqualified leads get value (honesty, resources) even if we can't partner.

### Scenario 2: Social Media DM Inquiry

**Context:**
Someone DMs on LinkedIn or Instagram: "How much do you charge for marketing services?"

**Brand Behavior:**
1. **Respond within a few hours** (same day if possible)
2. **Clarify before quoting**: "Good question! Before I give you a number, can I ask: Are you looking for someone to run campaigns, or do you want to build a complete growth system that connects marketing to sales?"
3. **Educate gently**: "We don't do isolated marketing services. We partner to build growth systems—campaigns are just one part of that."
4. **Offer next step**: "If you want to discuss your specific situation, I can send you a link to schedule a call. Or I can point you to some free resources that might help."
5. **Don't ghost if they're not qualified**: "Based on what you're looking for, we might not be the right fit. Here's who I'd recommend instead."

**Voice/Avatar:** The Growth Partner (warm, relational, helpful)

**Communication Style:**
- Casual but professional
- Voice notes okay for warmth (if natural)
- Emoji use: Minimal, purposeful

**Outcome Goal:**
Build trust even if they're not ready now. They remember us as helpful, not salesy.

## Sales & Partnership Scenarios

### Scenario 3: Discovery Call with Potential Partner

**Brand Behavior:**
1. **Start with context, not pitch**: "Tell me about your business. What made you start looking for help now?"
2. **Listen more than talk** (70/30 rule)
3. **Ask diagnostic questions**:
   - What have you tried so far?
   - What did you expect vs. what actually happened?
   - What does success look like for you? (specific revenue number)
   - How does your current marketing connect to your sales process?
   - Where do most leads fall off in your pipeline?
   - What's your current marketing budget?
4. **Diagnose before prescribing**: "Based on what you shared, here's what I see as the real bottleneck..."
5. **Be honest about readiness**: "Here's what I recommend: [option A] if you're ready to invest in building a complete system, or [option B] if you need to start smaller."
6. **No pressure close**: "Does this sound like what you need? If so, I'll send you a proposal. If not, no worries—here's what I'd do if I were you."

**Voice/Avatar:** The Systems Architect (strategic, consultative, diagnostic)

4. **Show the expected outcomes**: Revenue projections, expected CAC, timeline to results
5. **Transparent pricing**: Flat monthly investment, no hidden fees, clear deliverables
6. **Set realistic expectations**: "Here's what you'll see in 30 days, 60 days, 90 days."

- Provide value even if they're not a lead
- Invite further conversation if relevant

**Example:**
Q: "How do I know if I'm ready for paid ads?"
A: "Good question. You're ready when: 1) You have consistent revenue ($10K+/month), 2) Your offer converts organically, 3) You can handle more demand, 4) You have budget to test ($2K+/month). If you're not there yet, focus on the fundamentals first. Happy to chat specifics if you want."

- Acknowledge respectfully
- Respond with data or logic, not defensiveness
- Don't engage with trolls

**Example:**
Comment: "Paid ads don't work anymore."
Response: "I get why it feels that way—the platforms have changed a lot. But we're still seeing 3-5x ROAS for partners when the system is built right. The difference: ads alone don't work. Ads connected to proper follow-up and sales? That's where the revenue happens. Happy to share what's working if you're interested."
