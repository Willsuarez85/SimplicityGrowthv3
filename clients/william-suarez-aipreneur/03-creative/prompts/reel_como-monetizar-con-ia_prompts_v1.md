[MODEL]: flux_dev
[TYPE]: image
[AVATAR]: William Suarez - El Arquitecto de Sistemas
[SCENARIO]: Educational content - framework visualization
[FORMAT]: Instagram Reel overlay graphic (9:16 context)

[MAIN PROMPT]:
A clean whiteboard diagram showing the contrast between "tools" and "systems" thinking.

Left side labeled "TOOLS" with scattered, disconnected icons drawn in black marker - representing isolated AI tools (chat bubble, gear, robot head, document icons) arranged chaotically with no connections.

Right side labeled "SYSTEMS" with a clean flowchart of connected nodes - four circles connected by arrows forming a logical workflow, representing organized systems thinking.

A bold black arrow points from left to right, showing the transition from chaos to order.

Hand-drawn marker style, slightly imperfect lines that feel human and authentic. Black marker on white background. Minimal, educational, professional.

[STYLE GUIDANCE]:

[AVATAR]: William Suarez - El Arquitecto de Sistemas
[SCENARIO]: Educational content - monetization framework
[FORMAT]: Instagram Reel overlay graphic (9:16 context)

[MAIN PROMPT]:
A vertical whiteboard diagram showing three numbered paths stacked vertically:

"1. SERVICIO" at top with a simple icon of a person at a computer (stick figure style, marker-drawn)

"2. PRODUCTO" in middle with a simple box/package icon (marker-drawn outline)

"3. SISTEMA" at bottom with a diagram of four connected nodes forming a network pattern (circles connected by lines)

Each label is written in bold black marker, left-aligned. The icons are to the right of each label. The third item "SISTEMA" has a rectangular highlight box drawn around it in thicker lines, emphasizing it as the key concept.

Hand-drawn marker style on white background. Black marker only. Educational framework visualization. Clean, minimal, professional.

[STYLE GUIDANCE]:
- Vertical layout for 9:16 compatibility
- Marker-drawn, imperfect lines

[SCENARIO]: Problem visualization - overwhelm state
[FORMAT]: Instagram Reel B-roll (9:16)

[MAIN PROMPT]:
A computer monitor displaying multiple overlapping browser windows and tabs, creating visual chaos. The screen shows fragments of different AI tool interfaces - chat windows, dashboards, tool logos partially visible. The overall impression is overwhelming digital clutter.

The workspace around the monitor is modern but slightly messy - perhaps a coffee cup, scattered papers. The lighting is flat, slightly desaturated, creating an anxious or overwhelming atmosphere.

The color palette is predominantly gray and muted, with occasional bright interface elements creating visual noise. The mood is "too much information, too many options."

Modern workspace photography style. Slightly desaturated, editorial feel. The chaos is the subject.

[STYLE GUIDANCE]:
- Modern tech workspace
- Multiple overlapping windows/tabs visible
- Desaturated, gray-leaning color grade
- Slight visual anxiety in composition

The workspace features natural wood desk surface, a small plant, warm ambient lighting from a desk lamp. Through a window, the night sky is visible. No person is present - the emphasis is on the system working autonomously.

The atmosphere is peaceful, intentional, controlled. The color palette is warm and muted - amber light, dark wood, deep shadows, with the screen providing cool contrast.

Editorial photography style. Moody, atmospheric. The feeling is "this is working while you rest."

[STYLE GUIDANCE]:
- Night atmosphere, low ambient light
- Computer screen as primary light source
- Warm wood and plant elements visible
- Clean, organized workspace
- No person in frame
- Peaceful, not eerie
- Editorial/lifestyle photography quality

[VISUAL REFERENCES]:

[SCENARIO]: Concept visualization - agent network
[FORMAT]: Instagram Reel B-roll (9:16)

[MAIN PROMPT]:
An abstract visualization of an AI agent system - glowing nodes connected by flowing lines on a dark background. The nodes pulse with soft activity, representing agents working. Data appears to flow between the connection points.

The color scheme is predominantly black background with white/light gray nodes and connection lines. Subtle sage green (#87A96B) accents highlight active connections or key nodes.

The visualization is clean and minimal, not busy or overly complex. Think architectural diagram meets data visualization. The feeling is organized intelligence, coordinated work.

### Post-Production Notes for Editor

1. **Whiteboard Graphics:**
   - May need sage green (#87A96B) accent added in post
   - Consider animating "draw-in" effect
   - Ensure contrast works over video backgrounds

2. **B-Roll:**
   - Color grade to match overall reel aesthetic
   - BR-001 should feel distinctly "before" (colder, desaturated)
   - BR-002 should feel distinctly "after" (warmer, calmer)

3. **Avatar:**
   - Reference frame is for consistency checks
   - Actual talking-head footage will be filmed
   - Use for style reference only
