## Content Gaps

### Gap 1: Claude Code Education in Spanish

**Current State:**
- Zero identified Spanish-language YouTube channels focused on Claude Code

- David Ondrej is the primary English Claude content creator

**Market Reality:**
- Claude Code launched in 2024, still emerging
- Spanish content typically lags English by 6-12 months
- Window exists for first-mover positioning

---

- Near-zero educational content in any language
- Documentation exists but no tutorial ecosystem

**Evidence:**

- No Spanish content identified
- Even English content is limited to documentation and basic introductions

**Market Reality:**
- Technology is genuinely new (months old)
- Category creation opportunity exists
- Technical barrier to entry is high

---

### Gap 3: AI Agent Building for Small Business

**Current State:**
- Most agent content targets developers or agency builders
- Small business applications rarely addressed
- Generic examples (chatbots, summarizers) vs. specific use cases

**Evidence:**
- Liam Ottley focuses on agency model (B2B service)
- David Ondrej targets technical builders
- Victor Perez IA covers surface-level automation
- No content specifically for restaurant, retail, service business owners

**Market Reality:**
- Small businesses represent largest market segment
- Complexity barrier prevents current content from serving them
- Specific use cases (inventory, scheduling, customer service) unaddressed

---

### Gap 4: Vibe Coding for Non-Programmers

**Current State:**
- Vibe coding concept coined by Andrej Karpathy (2025)
- Collins Dictionary Word of the Year 2025

---

### Gap 5: Anti-Hype AI Education

**Current State:**
- Most AI content uses excitement/urgency/income claims
- "Make money with AI" saturates market

- DotCSV occasionally does events but not regular lives
- Community engagement limited to comments

**Market Reality:**
- Live content builds community
- Higher engagement but more resource-intensive
- Differentiator from recorded-only competition

---

### Gap 8: Newsletter in Spanish AI Education

- Building complete systems rarely taught
- Integration/workflow content limited

**Evidence:**
- Victor Perez IA: tool tutorials

1. **AI news commentary** = Matt Wolfe, Wes Roth, many others
2. **ChatGPT tips** = Oversaturated in all languages

## Analytical Conclusion

The competitive analysis reveals that the intersection of:
- Spanish language
- Claude Code / MCP focus
- AI agent building
- Entrepreneur (not developer) audience
- Anti-hype, practical positioning

...represents market territory that is currently unoccupied by any identified competitor.

This observation is analytical, not prescriptive. The strategic implications of this gap are for strategy teams to determine.
