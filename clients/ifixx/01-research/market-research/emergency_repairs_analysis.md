## Property Management Opportunity

### Property Manager Pain Points

| Inconsistent quality | Medium - rework costs | Indirect |

## Insurance & Restoration Channel

### How It Works

1. Water damage, storm, fire occurs
2. Homeowner files insurance claim
3. Insurance adjuster approves scope
4. Restoration company does major work
5. General repairs remain for handyman
6. Insurance pays (with deductible)

### Certification Advantage

| Certification | Purpose | Value |
|---------------|---------|-------|
| IICRC (Water damage) | Water mitigation | Opens insurance referrals |
| Lead-Safe Certified | Pre-1978 home work | Required for some jobs |
| EPA Certification | Refrigerant handling | HVAC-adjacent work |

**Observation:** Certified general handymen can capture post-restoration work that doesn't require trade specialists.
