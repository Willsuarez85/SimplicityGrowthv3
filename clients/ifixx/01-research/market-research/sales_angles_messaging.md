## Pricing Communication Patterns

### Observed Pricing Models

| Model | Who Uses It | Customer Perception |
|-------|-------------|---------------------|
| Hourly + materials | Mr. Handyman, most locals | Familiar, but anxiety about final cost |
| Flat rate per job | Some specialists | Preferred by customers, higher trust |
| Minimum charge | Hands4Hire ($140) | Sets expectations, filters small jobs |
| Free estimates | Most locals | Expected, but time cost for provider |
| Trip/fuel charge | Mr. Handyman ($30+) | Frustration point in reviews |

### Pricing Transparency Gap

**Observation:** Almost no Charlotte handyman businesses publish pricing online. Common objections to transparency:
- "Every job is different"
- "Need to see the scope first"

**Customer Reality:** Reviews consistently mention pricing surprise as frustration point. Competitors who set clear expectations (even ranges) receive better reviews.

| Unknown final cost | "Free estimates" (doesn't fully address) |
