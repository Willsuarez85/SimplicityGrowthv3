## Recommended Strategy: Handyman & Emergency Focus

### Why Handyman Wins for Ifixx

1. **Faster Path to Revenue**
   - Start generating cash in weeks, not months
   - Lower marketing investment to compete
   - Volume smooths cash flow

2. **Better Competitive Position**
   - 5 years experience is above average for handyman
   - 5-person team is adequate for coverage
   - Digital gaps give first-mover advantage

3. **Multiple Differentiation Options**
   - Emergency 24/7 (almost no competition)
   - Subscription model (no competition)
   - Online booking (minimal competition)
   - Transparent pricing (no competition)

4. **Lower Capital Risk**
   - $15K-30K marketing vs. $50K-100K
   - Faster breakeven point
   - More jobs = less dependency on any one

5. **Natural Upsell Path**
   - Handyman relationship → trust built → remodeling work
   - Can capture kitchen/bath leads organically
   - Test big projects with lower risk

### Recommended Positioning

**Primary Focus:** Handyman & Emergency Services
**Secondary Focus:** Small remodeling projects ($5K-15K) that come from handyman relationships
**Future Expansion:** Kitchen & Bath AFTER establishing handyman dominance (18-24 months)

|-----|----------|-----|
| Emergency 24/7 Service | #1 | Almost zero competition, premium pricing |
| Online Booking | #2 | Differentiates immediately, modern experience |
| Transparent Pricing | #3 | Low cost to implement, builds trust |
| Property Management | #4 | B2B recurring revenue |
| Subscription Model | #5 | Recurring revenue, customer lock-in |
