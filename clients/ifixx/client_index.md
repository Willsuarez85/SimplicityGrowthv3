## Strategic Positioning

### The Strategic Decision

Based on comprehensive market research comparing Kitchen & Bath Remodeling vs. Handyman & Emergency Services:

| Factor | Handyman | K&B |
|--------|----------|-----|
| **Viability Score** | **7.95** | 5.45 |
| **Competition** | Fragmented, beatable | Dominated by 20yr veterans |
| **Time to ROI** | 3-6 months | 18-24 months |
| **Capital Required** | $15K-30K | $50K-100K |

**Decision:** Handyman & Emergency Services is the recommended path.

### Core Positioning

> **"Ifixx is the first call when something goes wrong at home."**

**What We Are:**
- Fast, reliable help when things break
- Direct owner-to-client service
- Local, family-owned handyman service

**What We Are NOT:**
- Not a big contractor
- Not a franchise with call centers
- Not a luxury remodeler

**Positioning Rule:** Ifixx solves problems, not projects.
